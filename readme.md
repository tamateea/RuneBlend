## Features


- **Format Compatibility:** The plugin supports all OSRS formats and basic support for RS3 models.
- **Accurate Color Representation:** The plugin loads the color table directly from the game as a texture, ensuring that the imported models retain the exact colors found in Runescape.
- **Transparency Support:** The plugin handles transparent faces by generating a new material with applied transparency using the palette image.
- **Vertex Grouping:** For models made using their in-house Jaged tool editor, the plugin automatically creates vertex groups.
- **Armature Creation(WIP):** The plugin creates an armature (skeleton) for models created with the new animation system.
- **Textures(WIP):** Has some support for osrs textures.



**Note:** 

- Back face culling is applied by default.
- Skeletons are still a work in progress, some will be okay, bust most will not.
